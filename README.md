# BotBotBot
Coffee Assistant (BotBotBot) automates coffee preparation with a Universal Robots UR3. Recipes are defined in YAML and parsed in C++, orchestrating step-based primitives like GetCup, PullShot, and AddMilk. The system simulates robot actions and is ready for real UR3 integration via Python/URScript.
